									<p>
										Every February 2nd, a crowd of thousands gathers at Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to await a special forecast from a groundhog named Phil. Whether Phil has a forecasting ability is a century old debate.
									</p>
									<p>
										Based on the analysis of average temperatures of February and March, and snowfall data, we can predict whether February has entered Early Spring. Compared the determination results through the temperatures data and the results through snowfall data with Phil’s forecasts, and we can evaluate whether Phil has a real forecasting power, and we will know did Phil’s accuracy rate and did Phil’s forecast even worse than random chance?

									Compared Average of 1901-2000 February Temperature with each year February Average Temperature, if the single year’s Feb average temperature is lower than Average of Century years February Temperature, it marked “Below”, otherwise, it marked “Above”.

										When both Feb and Mar are above the century average temperature, we predict Early  Spring  coming.
									</li>
									<li>
										On the other hand, when both of them is below the century average temperature, we predict it still Winter.
									</li>
									<li>
										When Feb is below, but Mar is above, it indicated the temperature is gradually increasing, so we predict Early  Spring is coming.
									</li>
									<li>
										When Feb is above but Mar is below, it indicated the temperature is decreasing in the March, we predict it still Winter. Unless, if that year the Feb Average is higher than March, we can predict Early Spring is coming.

									Compared Average of Century Years February Snowfall with each year February Average Snowfall, if the single year’s Feb average temperature is lower than Average of Century Years February Snowfall it marked “Below”, otherwise, it marked “Above”.

								<p>
									If snow continually melts as it lands, and the accumulation never reaches 0.1 inches on your measuring surface, snowfall should be recorded as a trace (T) and record in your remarks that the "snow melted as it landed". So, when the value is T, it below the Average.
								</p>

									<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
								</div>
								
								<p>
								The temperature methodology Phil’s prediction accuracy is 25.8%, and the Snowfalls methodology Phil’s predication accuracy is 9.5%. The 4.1&4.2 hypothesis testing indicates that Phil has no predication power, and accuracy less than random chance. In addition, the Phil’s accuracy determined by two different methodology, their results have a statistically significant different. </p>
